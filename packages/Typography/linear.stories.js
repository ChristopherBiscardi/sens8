        Typography is a central part of any user interface, especially on the
        web. This set of components are meant to fulfill any typographic need,
        be it headings, display text, citations, emphasis, or quotes.

        Hereâ€™s how it all got started. The goal with&nbsp;
        <Link href="https://gatsbymanor.com">Gatsby Manor</Link> (a separate
        project, unaffiliated with the Gatsby core team) is to create
        professional designed Gatsby starters to give your site a clean, modern
        look the moment you create a new project. While creating our newest
        starter&nbsp;
        <Link href="https://gatsbymanor.com/demo/eventually">
          gatsby-starter-eventually
        </Link>, I wanted to organize the directory structure of the project to
        better fit my workflow.

        Gatsby core automatically turns React components in{" "}
        <strong>src/pages</strong> into pages. Prior to this plugin, that
        functionality was only available to Gatsby core as an internal plugin.
        There was no way to have a different folder automatically create pages
        from components because the default <strong>src/pages</strong>
        path was hardcoded. The side effect of this behavior is that you have a
        hard time creating folder structures that best fit your needs. If you
        wanted all your javascript to live in a single folder, you would lose
        the ability to automatically create pages.
