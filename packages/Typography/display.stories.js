        Hereâ€™s how it all got started. The goal with&nbsp;
        <Link href="https://gatsbymanor.com">Gatsby Manor</Link> (a separate
        project, unaffiliated with the Gatsby core team) is to create
        professional designed Gatsby starters to give your site a clean, modern
        look the moment you create a new project. While creating our newest
        starter&nbsp;
        <Link href="https://gatsbymanor.com/demo/eventually">
          gatsby-starter-eventually
        </Link>, I wanted to organize the directory structure of the project to
        better fit my workflow.

        Gatsby core automatically turns React components in{" "}
        <strong>src/pages</strong> into pages. Prior to this plugin, that
        functionality was only available to Gatsby core as an internal plugin.
        There was no way to have a different folder automatically create pages
        from components because the default <strong>src/pages</strong>
        path was hardcoded. The side effect of this behavior is that you have a
        hard time creating folder structures that best fit your needs. If you
        wanted all your javascript to live in a single folder, you would lose
        the ability to automatically create pages.
